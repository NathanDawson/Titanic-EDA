# Exploratory Data Analysis of The Titanic Disaster

In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic disaster dataset to uncover valuable insights about the factors influencing passenger survival rates. The primary objective was to understand the dynamics of this historical tragedy and gain a deeper knowledge of the passengers' demographics and conditions.

I started by describing the variables in the dataset, such as age, port of embarkment, and passenger class. After cleaning the data and handling missing values, I delved into visualisations to better grasp the data's distribution and relationships between different features. Through various plots and charts, I identified significant patterns, correlations, and trends.

The analysis revealed that certain factors, such as passenger class, played a crucial role in determining survival rates. Additionally, age seemed to impact survival chances. These findings offered important insights into the events surrounding the Titanic disaster and highlighted the disparities in survival rates across different groups.

Overall, this EDA provided a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and enriched my knowledge of the Titanic disaster, shedding light on the human stories and dynamics that unfolded during that tragic event.
